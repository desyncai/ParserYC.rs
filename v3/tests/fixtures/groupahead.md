### Improve communications with your group's own mobile app.

Founder/CTO
2 x YC technical founder (with 1 exit to Google). A mix of leadership and IC work over my career, dominated by zero-to-one product design &amp; development in startups. Entrepreneurship has crafted me into a resourceful generalist, with a specialization in the Frontend stack &amp; user-facing features. I'm continually excited to learn and delve deep into new technologies, and do what's required to help find product traction and achieve success.
